PART 2
Passwords cracked: 1132
Total time: 25:56.701
Number of hashes computed: 621455537
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 0.0000018215
Time per password cracked: 1.375s

Factor by which the time per password lengthened: 17.8. This was because we had
to compute a lot more hashes (about 2000x more) to get each password than we
did the first time. Without salting, we could test each hashed word against every
password, but with a unique salt contributing to the hash of each password,
we needed a new hash for every word/password attempt. This is why it took
so much longer the second time.
